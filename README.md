# Screenie Meanie

Saw a movie recently and want to sound-off? Screenie Meanie is a platform where you can tell us about movies you hate to love or love to hate!

We put all the movies you watched into your profile.  You can tell your friends how you really feel about movies you watched, link to it and a movie poster, and upvote and comment on friends reviews.
